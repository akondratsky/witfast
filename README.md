# WitFast

WitFast is a minimalistic Chrome Extension for injecting predefined text values through the context menu and one root item.

Check screenshots, if you are not sure.

## Installation

This is a one-time experiment and I'm not going to register account for Chrome extensions development, you have only one option: install it manually.

1. Download the archive from the latest [release](https://github.com/akondratsky/witfast/releases)
2. Unpack the archive
3. Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Switch `Developer mode` on.
5. Press `Load unpacked` button and select the folder with extension files
6. Viola!
